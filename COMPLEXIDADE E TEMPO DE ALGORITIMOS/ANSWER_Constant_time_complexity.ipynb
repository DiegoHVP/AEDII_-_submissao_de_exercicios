        "\n",
        "Since N operations cost O(N) , we can amortize the cost of a single operation by dividing the total cost by the number of operations. In this case, by dividing O(N) by N we get O(N) / N = O(1) for each **list.append()**. We then say that **list.append()** has **amortized complexity** of O(1).\n",

If we need more complex operations, odds are that there is a more efficient data structure for storing the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Looping over all list elements is not on the above table because it is not a list method. But it is efficient to do so since it takes O(N) to iterate over N elements in a list. No data structure can do this faster because, as we've learned. We cannot look at N values faster than O(N) since, inspecting a single memory location takes O(1).\n",

Since the size of numbers in Python can grow as large as the computer memory allows, we conclude that arithmetic operations cannot be performed in constant time in Python.\n",

        "Arithmetic operations are yet another common example of hidden function calls in Python. The code **x + y** in Python is a syntactic sugar for **x.__add__(y)**. The same is true for other arithmetic operations. For example, **x * y** corresponds to **x.__mul__(y)**. The time complexity of doing an arithmetic operation between two integers depends on the number of digits required to represent them.\n",

Only fields like cryptography care about the complexity of handling very large numbers since they use them constantly.\n",
